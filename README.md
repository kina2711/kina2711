Hello everyone! My name is **Kien**, my full name is **Thai Trung Kien**, and you can call me **Rabbit**. I have a deep passion for **data analysis** and **building data systems**, and I currently have nearly **one year of professional experience** in Data Analytics and Data Warehouse (DWH) system development. I am fully committed to this career transition—starting as an entry-level Data Analyst, while simultaneously on the path toward Data Engineering, where I can design and maintain scalable data pipelines and warehouses.

I studied at **Hanoi University of Pharmacy**. It may seem unrelated to my passion, right? However, during my time there, I developed essential qualities such as **perseverance**, **resilience**, **attention to detail**, and **logical reasoning**—all of which are crucial when working with **data**.

After completing a rigorous **five-year Bachelor of Pharmacy program**, I built a solid foundation in the field of **pharmaceutical sciences**. However, my true passion lies in **Information Technology**, particularly in **Data Analytics** and **data system architecture**. Recognizing this, I decided to pivot my career toward these fields.
